# Challenge Submission


## Logic Test
### 1. Please write a function to find the index that has the sum of left’s elements equal to the sum of right’s elements .

Example 1: input => [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] output => "middle index is 3

Example 2: input => [3, 6, 8, 1, 5, 10, 1, 7] output => "middle index is 4"

Example 3: input => [3, 5, 6] output => "index not found"


### 2. Please write a function to detect that incoming string is palindrome or not 
Example 1: input => "aka", output => "aka is a palindrome"

Example 2: input => "Level", output => "Level is a palindrome"

Example 3: input => "Hello", output => "Hello isn’t a palindrome"

Note: Please use only the basic programming function like if-else, loop, etc.

## Coding Test
Create the News’s application that contain 2 pages.

First, show a list of news through this services (https://newsapi.org) to handle the list and pagination

Second, show a news detail that based on selected one.

Required:
1. VIPER or MVVM is preferred

Plus (optional):
1. Modularization Architecture
2. RxSwift, Combine, or Async-Await for iOS. RxJava or Coroutine for Android 
3. Unit test
4. Animation and transition in the app

Note:
1. You can create any design you want or try to make it look like below. 
2. You can use any libraries that you want also.
3. You can add anything that you think this app must have also.

## Solution

I have added these two tests into single projects so that you can just build and run.

### Project struct

- Main App
- Module MVVM
- Module LogicTest
- Module CodingTest

### Design pattern
- [ ] Modularization Architecture
- [ ] MVVM
